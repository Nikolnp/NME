Java Web Application 

Project Summary:

In this Project I have combined my Java,JPQL,SQL and GlassFish server skills with basic HTML and CSS to build A Web Application.
The application represents an online Record label,which allows users to login and access pages with information and reports about Artists, Albums and Tracks from a relational database. They can modify and update the database through the GUI. Different users have specific access rights to the application.

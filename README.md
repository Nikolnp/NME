Java Web Application 

Project Summary:

In this Project I have combined my Java,JPQL,SQL and GlassFish server skills with basic HTML and CSSto build A Web Application.
The application allows users to login and access pages with information and reports from a database. They can modify certain data and update the database through the GUI. Different users have specific access rights to the application.
